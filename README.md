## 1. Factorial of a number

The **factorial** of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted by n!.

### **Mathematical Definition:**
**n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) ......3 x 2 x 1**

### **Example**
1. **0! = 1**
2. **1! = 1**
3. **4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1**


## 2. Fibonacii Series

The **Fibonacci series** is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 

### **Mathematical Definition:**
**f(0) = 0**
**f(1) = 1**
**f(2) = f(0) + f(1)**
**f(3) = f(1) + f(2)**

### **Example**
**0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.....**
