## 1. Factorial of a number

The **factorial** of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted by n!.

### **Mathematical Definition:**
**n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) ......3 x 2 x 1**

### **Example**
1. **0! = 1**
2. **1! = 1**
3. **4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1**


## 2. Fibonacii Series

The **Fibonacci series** is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. 

### **Mathematical Definition:**
1. **f(0) = 0**
2. **f(1) = 1**
3. **f(2) = f(0) + f(1)**
4. **f(3) = f(1) + f(2)**

### **Example**
**0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21.....**


## 3. Sum of the Digites

The **addition of the digits** present in the given number. 

### **Example**
1. **sum(123) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6**
2. **sum(1) = 1**


## 3. Reverse the Number

The **reverse the digits** of the given number. 

### **Example**
1. **123 = 321**
2. **23456 = 65432**


## 4. Armstrong Number
An **Armstrong number** is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

For an number ùëõ = abc
a, b, c are the digits of the number, Therefore the count of the number is 3. 
The number is an Armstrong number if:

abc = a ^ count + b ^count + c ^ count.

**Examples:**
1. **153:**
count = 3
1 ^ 3 + 5 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
So, 153 is an Armstrong number.

2. **9474:**
count = 4;
9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 6561 + 256 + 2401 + 256 = 9474
So, 9474 is an Armstrong number.


## 5. GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
The **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. It is also known as the greatest common factor (GCF) or highest common factor (HCF).

**Example**
1.GCD(
